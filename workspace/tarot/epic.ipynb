    "The game Jumpers is played by two players on a board configured in an n-by-n grid. Each space on the board can be unoccupied or occupied by a piece from either player. During a player's turn, the player attempts to jump over as many of the opponent's pieces as possible. A piece can jump over a single opponent's horizontally or vertically adjacent piece if the landing space, the next space in the same direction, is unoccupied. After landing, the same piece can immediately jump over another opponent's piece, to which it is now horizontally or vertically adjacent, and so forth, until no more jumps are possible for that piece. The player's piece cannot jump over the same piece more than once. Write a function which defines the number of jumps and the longest possible jump path for a piece at a given location on a board. The two-dimensional array representing the board and the coordinates of the specific piece will be passed into the function as parameters. In the array, 0 denotes an unoccupied space, 1 denotes a space in which player 1 has a piece, and 2 denotes a space in which player 2 has a piece. You may assume the input is valid. For example, if this is the board, \n",
