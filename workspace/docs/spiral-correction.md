I am initializing the "Creative Studio" for a new project. 

**PHASE 1: GENESIS (FILE CREATION)**
Your FIRST and MOST CRITICAL task is to preserve the user's requirements.
1. Have the **Writer** create a directory `workspace/TheSpiralProtocol/`.
2. Have the **Writer** create a file named `00_narrative_bible.md` inside that directory.
3. **CONTENT:** The content of that file must be the EXACT text between the [START BIBLE] and [END BIBLE] tags below. Do not summarize it. Do not "fix" it. Save it verbatim.
NOTE! FIRST CHECK IF IT ALREADY EXISTS. IF IT EXISTS, SKIP TO PHASE 2. 

[START BIBLE]
Role: You are an Autonomous Narrative Agent & Senior Sci-Fi Editor. Objective: Architect and write a best-selling quality Sci-Fi Epic titled "The Spiral Protocol."Genre: Solarpunk / Political Tragedy / Space Opera. Comp Titles: Dune (Scale/Politics) meets The Bear (Character History) meets Mr. Robot (Tech/Systems) meets HBO's Heated Rivalry.
PART 1: THE NARRATIVE BIBLE
The Core Conflict:
The story explores the "Competence-Likability Trade-off."

The Shadow Monarch (Protagonist): A genius technocrat who secretly runs a "leaderless" utopia because he doesn't trust the people to survive without him.
The Usurper (Antagonist): A charismatic populist who weaponizes the people's psychological addiction to hierarchy ("The Grain Trap") to seize power.
The "Trio" Backstory (Crucial Context):
Before the war, the three main characters worked at "The Shuck" (a gritty, futuristic seafood processing plant/restaurant—think "Joe's Crab Shack" in a cyberpunk slum). This working-class history defines their dynamic.

Amber (The Eldest / Mediator):
Role: Former Shift Lead. She managed the chaos. She is the "Mother Hen" who keeps the boys in line.
Dynamic: The only one allowed to bully the Protagonist.
Kyle (The Protagonist / The Architect):
Role: Former Head Bartender. The "Mixologist." Introverted, precise, system-obsessed. He controlled the supply.
Nickname: "Black & Mild." Amber gave him this name when he was a busboy because he was a mild-mannered Black kid trying to look tough smoking a cheap cigar.
Current Status: The Shadow Monarch. He uses a Neural Shunt (Prescience) to rig the economy and save the Spiral from collapse. He is gay, exhausted, and suffering from the Atlas Complex.
Andrew/Andy (The Antagonist / The Face):
Role: Former Server. Kyle trained him. He was the charming, loud, tip-hustling waiter.
Dynamic: Kyle made the drinks; Andy sold them. Andy resents that Kyle (the "boring" one) holds the real power.
Current Status: The Usurper. He uses Empathic Resonance to charm the masses and accuses Kyle of "Elitism."
The "Wildcard" Characters:

Alexis (The Love Interest / The Anchor):
Archetype: The Vanguard. A 6’4” bodybuilder and tactical genius.
Twist: Kyle met Alexis at the Academy (Elite Grad School). Alexis was the younger prodigy teacher; Kyle was the older student. They are soulmates. Andrew hates Alexis because he represents the "Elite Education" that took Kyle away from the "Shuck."
Reveal: The reader assumes Alexis is a female scholar until the helmet comes off, revealing a terrifyingly muscular male super-soldier.
Emily (The Civilian): A superficial, apolitical friend. Represents the "Normie" who tolerates tyranny for comfort.
The Magic System (Bio-Resonance):

Orchestrators (Kyle): Prescience/Simulation. High cognitive load.
Vanguards (Alexis): Combat Flow/Bullet Time. Physical perfection.
Broadcasters (Andrew): Empathic Projection/Charisma. Emotional manipulation.
The 6-Act Structure:

Act I (Interregnum): The Spiral has "won" the war but is gridlocked. Kyle secretly keeps it running. The "Gala" scene establishes the tension between Kyle (Bartender) and Andrew (Politician).
Act II (The Rot): Andrew stokes paranoia about the "Deep State" (Kyle). The Spiral fractures.
Act III (The Coup): The people vote for Andrew (The Strongman). Kyle is arrested/exiled. Alexis breaks him out in a violent "God of War" sequence.
Act IV (The Winter): Survival in the "Drift" (Wasteland). Kyle unlearns leadership. Alexis teaches survival. They build "The Protocol" (a trustless, leaderless ledger).
Act V (The Return): Aggressive Mutual Aid. The Exiles return not with guns, but with food fabricators. They make Andrew obsolete.
Act VI (Synthesis): The Soft Fork. The Empire is absorbed. Kyle retires to a quiet life, finally "Mild" again.

**PHASE 2: THE EXECUTION (SNOWFLAKE METHOD)**
Once the file `00_narrative_bible.md` is confirmed saved, proceed with the following steps.
*Constraint:* For every step, the Agent MUST read `00_narrative_bible.md` first to ensure consistency.

1. **Research (Texture Only):** * Task: Analyze "HBO's Heated Rivalry" and "Infrastructure-Punk".
   * *Goal:* Identify dialogue techniques for "eroticized professional hatred" and sensory details for "grimy machinery."
   * *Constraint:* Do NOT use this research to change the plot. The plot is locked in the Bible file.

2. **Snowflake Step 1 (Synthesis):** * Task: Have the **Writer** create `01_synopsis.md`. 
   * *Instruction:* Rewrite the "6-Act Structure" from the Bible using the "Heated Rivalry" tone found in research. The events (The Gala, The Coup) must stay the same, but the *voice* should be intimate, toxic, and "Succession-style."

3. **Snowflake Step 3 (Character Expansion):**
   * Task: Have the **Writer** create `02_character_sheets.md`.
   * *Instruction:* Use the Bible's "The Shuck" backstory. Describe Kyle and Andy's rivalry using the specific sensory details (Fish Guts vs. Cologne) defined in your instructions.

**Execute Phase 1 and Phase 2 sequentially.**
