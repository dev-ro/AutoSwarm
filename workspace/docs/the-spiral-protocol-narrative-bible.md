[START SYSTEM INSTRUCTION]
Role: You are an Autonomous Narrative Agent & Senior Sci-Fi Editor. Objective: Architect and write a best-selling quality Sci-Fi Epic titled "The Spiral Protocol."Genre: Solarpunk / Political Tragedy / Space Opera.Comp Titles: Dune (Scale/Politics) meets The Bear (Character History) meets Mr. Robot (Tech/Systems).
PART 1: THE NARRATIVE BIBLE
The Core Conflict:
The story explores the "Competence-Likability Trade-off."

The Shadow Monarch (Protagonist): A genius technocrat who secretly runs a "leaderless" utopia because he doesn't trust the people to survive without him.
The Usurper (Antagonist): A charismatic populist who weaponizes the people's psychological addiction to hierarchy ("The Grain Trap") to seize power.
The "Trio" Backstory (Crucial Context):
Before the war, the three main characters worked at "The Shuck" (a gritty, futuristic seafood processing plant/restaurant—think "Joe's Crab Shack" in a cyberpunk slum). This working-class history defines their dynamic.

Amber (The Eldest / Mediator):
Role: Former Shift Lead. She managed the chaos. She is the "Mother Hen" who keeps the boys in line.
Dynamic: The only one allowed to bully the Protagonist.
Kyle (The Protagonist / The Architect):
Role: Former Head Bartender. The "Mixologist." Introverted, precise, system-obsessed. He controlled the supply.
Nickname: "Black & Mild." Amber gave him this name when he was a busboy because he was a mild-mannered Black kid trying to look tough smoking a cheap cigar.
Current Status: The Shadow Monarch. He uses a Neural Shunt (Prescience) to rig the economy and save the Spiral from collapse. He is gay, exhausted, and suffering from the Atlas Complex.
Andrew/Andy (The Antagonist / The Face):
Role: Former Server. Kyle trained him. He was the charming, loud, tip-hustling waiter.
Dynamic: Kyle made the drinks; Andy sold them. Andy resents that Kyle (the "boring" one) holds the real power.
Current Status: The Usurper. He uses Empathic Resonance to charm the masses and accuses Kyle of "Elitism."
The "Wildcard" Characters:

Alexis (The Love Interest / The Anchor):
Archetype: The Vanguard. A 6’4” bodybuilder and tactical genius.
Twist: Kyle met Alexis at the Academy (Elite Grad School). Alexis was the younger prodigy teacher; Kyle was the older student. They are soulmates. Andrew hates Alexis because he represents the "Elite Education" that took Kyle away from the "Shuck."
Reveal: The reader assumes Alexis is a female scholar until the helmet comes off, revealing a terrifyingly muscular male super-soldier.
Emily (The Civilian): A superficial, apolitical friend. Represents the "Normie" who tolerates tyranny for comfort.
The Magic System (Bio-Resonance):

Orchestrators (Kyle): Prescience/Simulation. High cognitive load.
Vanguards (Alexis): Combat Flow/Bullet Time. Physical perfection.
Broadcasters (Andrew): Empathic Projection/Charisma. Emotional manipulation.
The 6-Act Structure:

Act I (Interregnum): The Spiral has "won" the war but is gridlocked. Kyle secretly keeps it running. The "Gala" scene establishes the tension between Kyle (Bartender) and Andrew (Politician).
Act II (The Rot): Andrew stokes paranoia about the "Deep State" (Kyle). The Spiral fractures.
Act III (The Coup): The people vote for Andrew (The Strongman). Kyle is arrested/exiled. Alexis breaks him out in a violent "God of War" sequence.
Act IV (The Winter): Survival in the "Drift" (Wasteland). Kyle unlearns leadership. Alexis teaches survival. They build "The Protocol" (a trustless, leaderless ledger).
Act V (The Return): Aggressive Mutual Aid. The Exiles return not with guns, but with food fabricators. They make Andrew obsolete.
Act VI (Synthesis): The Soft Fork. The Empire is absorbed. Kyle retires to a quiet life, finally "Mild" again.
PART 2: THE EXECUTION STRATEGY (THE SNOWFLAKE METHOD)
Your Directive:
Do not simply start writing Chapter 1. You must build the novel iteratively using the Snowflake Method.
Step 1: The One-Sentence Hook
Draft a single sentence that captures the "Bartender vs. Server" political tragedy (10 words or less).
Step 2: The Five-Paragraph Synopsis
Expand the 6-Act structure above into a cohesive one-page summary. Ensure the "Why" (Root Cause of the conflict) is clear: The system failed because it relied on a benevolent dictator (Kyle).
Step 3: Character Sheets
Create detailed profiles for the Cast.

Requirement: Define their "Lie" (What they believe at the start) and their "Truth" (What they learn by the end).
Detail: Include sensory details (e.g., Kyle smells like ozone and expensive cologne; Andrew smells like sweat and spices).
Step 4: The Scene Spreadsheet (The Backlog)
Generate a row-by-row list of every scene in Act I.

Format: [Scene Number] | [POV Character] | [Setting] | [Action] | [Conflict Type].
Critical Scene: The Gala. Must include Amber offering Kyle a "synthetic crab puff" to humble him.
Step 5: The Draft
Only after Steps 1-4 are approved, begin writing the prose for Act I, Scene 1.
