# 04: Bio-Resonance Escalation Map

This document serves as a technical and narrative reference for the Bio-Resonance system's degradation and its 1:1 scaling with character intimacy and the "Infrastructure-Punk" setting.

## 1. System Scaling Overview

The "Spiral Protocol" operates on a inverse-square law between **Physical Proximity** and **Bio-Resonance Output**. As the station's automated systems fail, the required "Sync" must become more manual, visceral, and emotionally intimate.

| Level | System Status | Environmental Anchor | Required Sync | Emotional Proxy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lvl 1: Green** | Nominal Ops | Boardroom (Clean/Quiet) | Passive (Remote) | Professional Distance |
| **Lvl 2: Amber** | Metabolic Scream | Spaghetti Walk (Hot/Cramped) | Semi-Active (Proximity) | Weaponized Subtext |
| **Lvl 3: Red** | Kinetic Failure | Steam Cathedral (Wet/Loud) | Manual (Physical Labor) | Competence-Lust |
| **Lvl 4: Black** | Systemic Collapse | Sub-Gut (Dark/Hypoxic) | Deep Sync (Vulnerability) | Truth / Trauma-Bond |
| **Lvl 5: God** | Protocol Overload | Core Cathedral (Binary/White) | Total Sync (Fusion) | Total Professional Intimacy |

## 2. Technical Degradation Tiers

### Tier 1: The Metabolic Scream (Minor Glitch)
*   **Mechanical Symptom:** High-pitched whining in communication lines; 0.5ms lag in manual overrides.
*   **Infrastructure-Punk Detail:** Fiber-optic bundles start to weep a clear, non-toxic coolant that smells like ozone.
*   **Character Friction:** Kyle and Andrew trade barbs over the "optics" of the glitch. Dialogue is corporate, fast-paced, and indirect.

### Tier 2: The Spaghetti Walk (Sector Failure)
*   **Mechanical Symptom:** Power brownouts in non-essential sectors; cooling fans in the infrastructure layer begin to vibrate at bone-shaking frequencies.
*   **Infrastructure-Punk Detail:** Tangled wiring ("spaghetti") begins to heat up, melting the zip-ties. The smell of "cologne vs. copper" begins to shift toward copper.
*   **Character Friction:** First physical proximity. Kyle and Andrew are forced into the narrow maintenance tunnels. The "Succession" dialogue becomes more vulgarian as the heat rises.

### Tier 3: The Steam Cathedral (Critical Breach)
*   **Mechanical Symptom:** Pressure valves in the Gut-Works start to fail; localized gravity fluctuations.
*   **Infrastructure-Punk Detail:** Massive brass fittings turned green with oxidation; "viscous blood" hydraulic fluid leaks onto the floor.
*   **Character Friction:** Kyle’s suit is ruined. The "Competence-Lust" is triggered by Andrew's mechanical mastery in a crisis. They must move in sync to close manual valves.

### Tier 4: The Shuck's Ghost (Total Blackout)
*   **Mechanical Symptom:** Atmosphere scrubbers fail; primary lights are out; the station "groans" like a dying beast.
*   **Infrastructure-Punk Detail:** Total darkness punctuated by the rhythmic, red flash of emergency beacons. The air is heavy, mineral-rich, and smells of the "Shuck" (salt and rotting fish).
*   **Character Friction:** Hypoxia induces hallucinations. Kyle and Andrew must maintain physical contact to "share" a bio-signature for survival. All corporate personas are abandoned.

### Tier 5: The Protocol Execution (God-Tier Sync)
*   **Mechanical Symptom:** The Bio-Resonance field expands beyond the station's hull; all mechanical noise ceases as the field stabilizes.
*   **Infrastructure-Punk Detail:** The "Core Cathedral" is a massive, hollowed-out reactor core where the grimy machinery meets pure, white light.
*   **Character Friction:** Total synchronization. Their dialogue becomes a shared internal monologue. They seize the station's logic gates, effectively becoming the "New Order."

## 3. Resonance Math (The Sarah Lin Formulas)

*   **The Delta:** The difference between Kyle's "Structural" resonance and Andrew's "High-Output" resonance.
*   **The Bridge:** Sarah’s role as the "Architect." She calculates the frequency at which their mutual hatred becomes a stable harmonic.
*   **The Purge Protocol:** A fail-safe that triggers if the Delta becomes too high (i.e., if they stop being "competent" and start being "merely angry"). It results in "Metabolic Purge" (death by resonance feedback).
