# Act II Outline: The Descent
**Project:** The Spiral Protocol
**Focus:** The Spaghetti Walk and the First Harmonic Discordance

## Overview
Act II follows Kyle Vance’s physical and psychological descent from the pristine Upper Deck into the visceral, decaying "Gut-Works." This act is defined by the "ruining of the suit"—the literal destruction of Kyle's corporate armor—and the first evidence that his and Andrew's bio-signatures are dangerously, erotically compatible despite their mutual discord.

## Plot Beats

### 1. The Airlock Transition (The Threshold)
*   **Action:** Kyle and Andrew pass through the Primary Pressure Seal. The transition is violent: a pressurized hiss followed by the cloying smell of burnt copper and stagnant mineral water.
*   **Sensory Anchor:** The sudden drop in air quality. Kyle’s Santal 33 is instantly overwhelmed by the "Gut-Works" signature of ozone and wet iron. 
*   **Dialogue Goal:** Andrew uses "Corporate Vulgarianism" to mock Kyle’s physical discomfort. Kyle responds with "Weaponized Inarticulacy," pretending the environment is a minor, uninteresting inconvenience.
*   **Bio-Resonance Status:** Passive monitoring. The station’s "Metabolic Scream" is a distant, 14kHz vibration felt in the teeth.

### 2. The Spaghetti Walk (The Physical Trial)
*   **Location:** Maintenance Conduit 4-Beta—a 200-meter catwalk suspended over the main cooling intake. The walls are a chaotic "spaghetti" of fiber-optics, leaking hydraulic lines, and zip-tied copper bundles.
*   **The Conflict:** The catwalk is narrow, forcing Kyle and Andrew into uncomfortable physical proximity. A high-pressure steam leak narrows the path further.
*   **The "Ruined Suit":** Kyle’s bespoke silk jacket is snagged on a rusted cable tie. He has to choose between tearing it or falling. Andrew refuses to help, watching with "Competence-Lust" as Kyle is forced to use a "Shuck-style" manual climb to bypass the obstruction.
*   **Sensory Anchor:** The "weeping" of the cables—thick, black lubricant dripping onto the diamond-plate flooring.

### 3. The First Harmonic Discordance (The Technical Failure)
*   **The Trigger:** A surge in the resonance dampeners requires a manual "Sync-Pulse" at a local node to prevent a deck-wide blackout.
*   **The Attempt:** Kyle and Andrew interface with the node. This is the first time they have shared a neural/biological link in years.
*   **The Discordance:** Instead of a smooth sine wave, their signatures produce a "Harmonic Discordance"—a jagged, violent feedback loop. 
    *   **Internal Effect:** Kyle feels Andrew’s raw, industrial aggression; Andrew feels Kyle’s cold, calculated arrogance.
    *   **External Effect:** The console sparks; Kyle is thrown back against the vibrating pipes.
*   **The Revelation:** The discordance isn't caused by a lack of skill, but by the intensity of their mutual obsession. They are "too loud" for the system.

### 4. Sarah Lin’s "Stability Collar" (The Political Pivot)
*   **Action:** A holographic transmission from Sarah Lin. She informs them that the Board has initiated the "Audit Protocol"—a precursor to the Purge.
*   **The Twist:** Sarah reveals she has adjusted their Bio-Resonance collars to "Self-Stabilizing" mode. In reality, she is tethering their life support to the station’s core stability. If the station dies, they die.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Sarah is clinical and detached (The Sterile Void), treating their potential deaths as a necessary data point for the Spiral's survival.

### 5. Entry into the Sub-Gut (The Point of No Return)
*   **Action:** They reach the heavy blast doors leading to the "Sub-Gut" (the deepest level). 
*   **Condition:** Kyle is now disheveled—jacket gone, sleeves rolled up, smeared with grease. He looks more like a "Shuck" laborer than a Shadow Monarch.
*   **The Moment:** Andrew recognizes the shift in Kyle. The hatred remains, but the "Competence-Lust" spikes. They realize that they cannot fix the Spiral without fully surrendering to the resonance that just tried to kill them.

## Tonal Constraints Checklist for Act II
- [ ] **Infrastructure-Punk:** Every scene must mention a mechanical failure (leaks, rust, grinding gears).
- [ ] **Succession Dialogue:** No one says what they mean. Use "uh," "um," and "look" to probe for status.
- [ ] **Competence-Lust:** Andrew should be visibly affected by Kyle’s ability to adapt to the grime.
- [ ] **The Shuck:** Subtle hints that Kyle has done this kind of manual labor before, despite his elite persona.
