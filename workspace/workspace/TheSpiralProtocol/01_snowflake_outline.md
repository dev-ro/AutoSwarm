# Snowflake Method Phase 1: The Spiral Protocol

## Phase 1: The One-Sentence Summary
Two rival technocrats must survive a bio-resonance meltdown in a decaying industrial megastructure by syncing their minds, despite a professional hatred that masks a deep addiction to each other's competence.

## Phase 2: The One-Paragraph Summary
On the Spiral, a crumbling industrial station, the elite technocrat Kyle Vance is forced into the grimy "Gut-Works" when the station's core enters a catastrophic "Metabolic Scream." There, he must partner with his bitter rival, the industrial engineer Andrew Thorne, to manually stabilize the system. As they navigate failing infrastructure and corporate betrayal from the Board, their bio-resonance synchronization forces an intrusive intimacy that threatens their political ambitions. They eventually realize the Board has set them up to be purged, leading them to embrace their "Competence-Lust" and execute a "God-tier" synchronization to seize absolute control of the station.

## 6-Act Structure Integration

1.  **Act I: The Fault Line:** Kyle Vance, in the pristine Upper Deck, manages a corporate crisis until the "Metabolic Scream" forces him to descend into the Gut-Works to find Andrew Thorne.
2.  **Act II: The Descent:** Kyle and Andrew must navigate the "Spaghetti Walk" of failing fiber-optics. Their first attempt at synchronization is a disaster of "Harmonic Discordance."
3.  **Act III: Resonance Failure:** The Board initiates a "Hostile Audit." Andrew attempts a "Solo Override" to cut Kyle out, which fails and nearly destroys the sector.
4.  **Act IV: The Shuck's Ghost:** Trapped in the Sub-Gut with failing oxygen, the rivals shed their corporate personas and confront their shared history, leading to the first moment of true synchronization.
5.  **Act V: The Protocol Execution:** Kyle and Andrew reach the Core Cathedral. They realize Sarah Lin is facilitating a station-wide purge. They initiate the "Spiral Protocol"—a total professional and mental intimacy.
6.  **Act VI: The New Order:** The "God-tier" sync is successful. Kyle and Andrew emerge as the binary sovereigns of the Spiral, issuing a cold, corporate ultimatum to the Board.
