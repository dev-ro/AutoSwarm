# Narrative Bible: The Spiral Protocol

## 1. Core Concept & Logline
**Logline:** In a crumbling industrial megastructure, two rival technocrats must synchronize their bio-signatures to prevent a catastrophic core meltdown, navigating a web of corporate betrayal and an eroticized professional hatred that threatens to consume them both.

**Core Conflict:** The Competence-Likability Trade-off. Success in the Spiral requires ruthless technical mastery, but the Bio-Resonance system requires a level of intimacy that makes such ruthlessness impossible to maintain in isolation.

## 2. Setting: The Spiral
The Spiral is a massive, decaying orbital station—a marvel of "Infrastructure-Punk."

*   **The Gilded Cage (Upper Deck):** Pristine, high-status corporate environments. Marble floors, glass walls, and the scent of expensive cologne. It masks the rot beneath.
*   **The Gut-Works (Lower Levels):** The industrial viscera of the station. Defined by "Spaghetti" wiring, weeping orange oxidized iron, the sharp tang of ozone, and the constant rhythmic thrum of overworked turbines.
*   **The Sub-Gut:** Decaying, lightless maintenance tunnels where the station's original "Shuck" foundations remain. A place of sensory deprivation and physical danger.

## 3. The Magic/Tech System: Bio-Resonance
The Spiral is powered by Bio-Resonance—a system that stabilizes the station’s gravitational and life-support cores through the synchronization of high-tier biological signatures.

*   **Synchronization:** Two or more individuals linking their metabolic rates and neural patterns. It requires absolute technical focus and an intrusive level of emotional proximity.
*   **The Metabolic Scream:** The state of total resonance failure. It manifests as a 14kHz rejection whine, boiling cooling gel, and environmental "hallucinations" of mechanical decay.
*   **Harmonic Discordance:** When synced individuals have conflicting agendas, the system mirrors their internal friction through physical malfunctions in their immediate environment.
*   **The Spiral Protocol:** A hidden emergency measure that allows for a "God-tier" synchronization, potentially granting the users absolute control over the station's systems at the cost of their individual autonomy.

## 4. Characters

### Kyle Vance (The Shadow Monarch)
*   **Role:** Lead Technocrat / Political Predator.
*   **Visual/Sensory:** Pristine silk suits, Santal 33 cologne, perfectly manicured hands.
*   **Background:** Hails from "The Shuck" (working class) but has spent a lifetime scrubbing the grease from his skin to dominate the Gilded Cage.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Weaponized Inarticulacy. Uses "ums," "uhs," and strategic stutter-steps (the "Velvet Shiv") to mask his origins and project elite indifference.

### Andrew Thorne (The Usurper)
*   **Role:** Chief Industrial Engineer / Rebel.
*   **Visual/Sensory:** Grimy coveralls, the scent of fish guts and ozone, scarred knuckles.
*   **Background:** A master of the Gut-Works who refuses to play the corporate game. He views Kyle’s ascent as a betrayal of their shared roots.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Corporate Vulgarianism. Rhythmic, ornate use of profanity and direct, emasculating technical assessments.

### Sarah Lin (The Architect)
*   **Role:** System Administrator / Observer.
*   **Visual/Sensory:** Clinical, white lab coats, the "Sterile Void" aesthetic.
*   **Function:** She views the eroticized rivalry between Kyle and Andrew as a functional component—fuel for the Bio-Resonance system. She is the high priestess of the machine.

## 5. Tonal Constraints
*   **Infrastructure-Punk:** Focus on the "industrial viscera"—leaking hydraulic fluid, rusted diamond-plate, and the heat of overworked fans.
*   **Succession-Style Dialogue:** No conversation is about what it's about. Every exchange is a subtextual power struggle.
*   **Competence-Lust:** The attraction between rivals is rooted in mastery. They are "turned on" by the other's ability to manipulate the system, even as they claim to hate each other.
