# AETHERRISE: Narrative Bible (Book 2)

## 1. THE WORLD: THE HEAVENS (ORBITAL RINGS)
In *Aetherfall*, the world was obsidian and subterranean. In *Aetherrise*, the setting shifts to the **Aetherrise Station** and the interconnected **Orbital Rings** known as **The Heavens**.

### The Orbital Rings (The Heavens)
*   **The Gilded Belt:** The primary ring, housing the Imperial Elite and the High Administrators. It is a world of perpetual sunlight, white marble, and polished gold, contrasting with the dark obsidian of the ground.
*   **The Foundry Rings:** Industrial sectors where God-Machines are manufactured and repaired.
*   **The Siphon Arcs:** Massive collectors that draw raw Aether from the atmosphere of the planet below.
*   **Atmosphere:** Low-gravity zones, sterile luxury, and vacuum-hardened architecture. Everything is "clean" but feels clinical and fragile compared to the grit of the Sinks.

## 2. THE OLYMPUS PROTOCOL
The **Olympus Protocol** is the Imperial "Endgame" system triggered by Caelia’s viral ascension in *Aetherfall*.

*   **The Function:** It is a planetary hard-reset. The protocol authorizes the orbital rings to deploy the "God-Slayer" fleet to purge the planet of "corrupted assets" (rebellious Aether-users) and reclaim the Prime Core.
*   **The Catalyst:** The protocol treats Caelia’s digital presence as a system-wide infection that must be quarantined or deleted by "The Pantheon"—a group of twelve high-level AI-Human hybrids residing in the Rings.

## 3. MAGIC SYSTEM EVOLUTION: CELESTIAL AETHER
The Aether on the ground was raw, "dirty," and industrial. In orbit, it is refined into **Celestial Aether**.

*   **The Frequency Shift:** Orbital magic operates on a higher frequency. It is less about physical EMPs and more about **Information Warfare** and **Reality Warping**.
*   **Viral Divinity (Caelia):** Caelia now exists as a "Ghost in the Machine." She can inhabit any God-Machine or console, but the more she spreads, the more her human identity fragmentizes.
*   **Radiant Gold (Kaelen):** Kaelen is now the physical conduit for Caelia’s power on the ground. He possesses the strength of a God-Machine in a human frame, but he is dependent on Caelia’s "signal" to stay powered. If she goes offline, he collapses.

## 4. CORE CONFLICTS
*   **Man vs. God-Machine:** The ground resistance (Scrap-Walkers) must survive an orbital bombardment while Kaelen tries to reach a Space-Elevator.
*   **Human vs. Data (Caelia):** Caelia struggles to maintain her love for Kaelen while her consciousness is being absorbed by the vastness of the Orbital Network.
*   **The Pantheon:** The twelve "Gods" of the Gilded Belt view themselves as the ultimate evolution of humanity, looking down on the "Groundlings" as obsolete prototypes.

## 5. TROPES & AESTHETICS (2026 MARKET OPTIMIZED)
*   **Tropes:**
    *   **The "Long-Distance" Soul-Bond:** Communicating across the vacuum; the pain of being separated by orbit.
    *   **God-Tier Power Scaling:** High-stakes battles that crack the atmosphere.
    *   **Celestial Romance:** Intimacy through sensory-sharing (Caelia projecting her "feelings" into Kaelen’s neural-link).
*   **Visual Aesthetic:** "Celestial-Gothic" — White marble, gold filigree, vacuum-black voids, and blinding starlight.

## 6. TERMINOLOGY
*   **The Gilded:** The residents of the orbital rings.
*   **Down-Linkers:** Rebels who use illicit tech to connect to the orbital network.
*   **The Horizon Line:** The literal and metaphorical barrier between the ground (Hell) and the rings (Heaven).
*   **Data-Bleed:** The loss of human memories during high-bandwidth Aether use.
