---

## **Chapter 1: The Cinder-Girl**
*Goal: Establish the grit, the "Gifted Kid Burnout," and the world's decay.*

*   **Scene 1: The Deep Vein.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Claustrophobic, oppressive. The air is thick with violet aether-dust that makes the skin itch.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia is working an illegal double shift in the obsidian mines. She uses a rusted "Aether-Siphon" to extract raw energy. We see her "Decision Fatigue"—she’s too tired to even be angry.  
    *   **Internal:** Her internal monologue reflects her burnout. She’s hiding her high sensitivity; if she’s found, she’s a slave to the state.
*   **Scene 2: The Collapse.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Chaos, mechanical screams.  
    *   **Action:** A support beam fails. A fellow miner (the only person who is kind to her) is about to be crushed. Caelia instinctively "pulses" her aether to freeze the falling rock for a split second.  
    *   **Hook:** She hides her glowing arms immediately, but a hidden drone’s lens pivots toward her.
*   **Scene 3: The Slum Nest.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Cyber-slum. Flickering neon, rain-slicked metal.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia returns to her "nest"—a tiny apartment filled with half-repaired mechanical parts. She tries to fix her mechanical bird (her "Secret Softness"). The sky turns violet as the Imperial Fleet arrives.

## **Chapter 2: The Shadow Commander**
*Goal: Introduce Kaelen Vance and the "Brutalist Elegance" of the antagonists.*

*   **Scene 1: The Descent.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Cold, clinical, terrifyingly efficient.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen’s shuttle, the *Obsidian Crow*, lands. He steps out into the grime of the mining colony. He looks like a god among insects.  
    *   **Internal:** His POV. He hates this place. It reminds him of the failures of his past. He’s here for a "Class-S Aether Signature" detected by the drones.
*   **Scene 2: The Colony Overseer.**  
    *   **Vibe:** High-tension dialogue.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen intimidates the corrupt Overseer. We see his "Shadow-Daddy" energy—he doesn't need to raise his voice to be lethal.
*   **Scene 3: The Discovery.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Tech-noir mystery.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen reviews the drone footage from Chapter 1. He sees Caelia’s "pulse." He doesn't just see a fugitive; he sees the solution to his own political survival.

---

## **Chapter 3: The Extraction**
*Goal: First meeting. High-stakes action and "Lethal Tension."*

*   **Scene 1: The Sweep.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Terror. Red sirens against violet night.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen’s Legion sweeps the slums. Caelia tries to escape through the vents.  
*   **Scene 2: The Dead End.**  
    *   **Vibe:** One-on-one confrontation.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen corners her on a high-rise catwalk. Rain is pouring. He uses his "Shadow-Command" (aether-gravity) to pin her down.  
*   **Scene 3: The Spark.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Visceral, electric.  
    *   **Action:** She fights back. When she touches his cybernetic arm, her amber aether and his violet energy "flare" violently, knocking them both back.  
    *   **Seriality Hook:** Kaelen’s mask cracks. For the first time, he looks shocked. "It’s you," he whispers, before knocking her out with a neural-dart.

---

## **Chapter 4: The Citadel of Glass**
*Goal: Shift setting to the High-Tech Capital. Establish the "Captured but Needed" dynamic.*

*   **Scene 1: The Glass Cage.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Ethereal, cold luxury.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia wakes up in a high-security medical bay in the Obsidian Spire. Kaelen is watching her through the glass.  
*   **Scene 2: The Negotiation.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Intellectual sparring.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen reveals she isn't there for execution. He needs her to pilot the *Aethelgard Prime*—the dormant God-Machine. Caelia refuses. Kaelen uses "The Guilt Trip" (mentioning the miners she left behind).
*   **Scene 3: The Processing.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Body-horror light.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia is "tagged." A sub-dermal chip is implanted. She is no longer a person; she is "Asset 734."

---

## **Chapter 5: [15% HOOK] The Blood Trial**
*Goal: The first major action set-piece. Prove the MMC/FMC "Power Dynamic."*

*   **Scene 1: The Pit.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Gladiatorial. Dark-Neon.  
    *   **Action:** The High Council (The antagonists) wants proof of her power. They throw her into the Aether-Synchrony Pit against a "Hollowed-Mech."  
*   **Scene 2: The Struggle.**  
    *   **Vibe:** High-paced combat.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia is rusty and terrified. The mech is winning. Kaelen watches from the balcony, his knuckles white on the railing (The "Shadow-Protector" urge).  
*   **Scene 3: The Surge.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Epic, world-shifting.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia is wounded. Her blood sprays onto the Pit's floor sensors. The entire Spire groans. She doesn't just fight the mech; she *controls* it. She shuts it down with a thought.  
    *   **Hook:** The High Council falls silent. Kaelen realizes she is more powerful than the legends—and twice as dangerous.

---

## **Chapter 6: The Golden Cage**
*Goal: Settle into the "Academy/Unit" vibe. Introduce the secondary cast.*

*   **Scene 1: Luxury & Chains.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Bittersweet.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia is moved to a lavish suite that is still a prison. She finds her mechanical bird has been brought to her—repaired. Kaelen’s doing.
*   **Scene 2: The Geas-Link.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Intimate, invasive.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen activates the Geas-Link. A violet tether appears between their wrists before fading into the skin. If she goes too far from him, it hurts. If he dies, she dies.  
*   **Scene 3: Meeting the 7th Legion.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Found Family (Initial Friction).  
    *   **Action:** Caelia meets Lyra (Kaelen’s 2nd-in-command) and Jace (the tech-specialist). They treat her with a mix of awe and suspicion.

---

## **Chapter 7: Training & Tension**
*Goal: Build the "Enemies-to-Lovers" simmer. Physical proximity.*

*   **Scene 1: The Obsidian Gym.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Sweaty, high-tension.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen insists on training her personally. No magic—just hand-to-hand combat.  
*   **Scene 2: The Lesson.**  
    *   **Vibe:** "Touch Her and You Die" seeds.  
    *   **Action:** Kaelen has to correct her stance. He stands behind her, hands on her hips. The physical contact causes their aether to hum. The "Enemies" vibe is cracking.  
*   **Scene 3: The Near-Break.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Emotional vulnerability.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia lashes out, exhausted. She demands to know why he cares. Kaelen almost tells her about his past failure. A moment of silence that is more intimate than a kiss.

---

## **Chapter 8: The Shadow Court**
*Goal: Political stakes. Caelia sees Kaelen’s "Human" side.*

*   **Scene 1: The Gala Entry.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Dangerous Elegance.  
    *   **Action:** Caelia is forced to attend a Council function as Kaelen’s "Ward." She is dressed in gold-threaded obsidian silks.  
*   **Scene 2: The Vultures.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Social combat.  
    *   **Action:** Other Commanders mock Kaelen for his "pet project." Caelia sees Kaelen’s mask of control slip. He’s fighting for his life in this court as much as she is.  
*   **Scene 3: The Warning.**  
    *   **Vibe:** Mystery/Ominous.  
    *   **Action:** In the gardens, a mysterious masked figure (The Seer) approaches Caelia. "The Commander isn't saving you," they whisper. "He’s just fattening you for the slaughter."  
    *   **Seriality Hook:** The figure disappears as Kaelen approaches. Caelia looks at his hand—the hand that fixed her bird—and wonders if she’s falling for her executioner.
