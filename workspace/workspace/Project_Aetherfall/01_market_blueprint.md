**Archetype Selection:** Archetype 1: The "Obsidian & Gold" Power Romantasy

### 1. The Trope-Stack (The "Viral Engine")
To dominate the 2026 discovery algorithms, *Aetherfall* utilizes a high-density trope-stack designed for maximum "Vibe" appeal:

1.  **Enemies-to-Lovers (Lethal):** The FMC is an assassin sent to kill the MMC; the MMC is the Shadow Commander who destroyed her home. Their chemistry is built on blades at throats.
2.  **"Touch Her and You Die" (The Shadow Protector):** Despite their rivalry, the MMC displays extreme, morally grey possessiveness when external threats emerge.
3.  **The "God-Machine" Catalyst (Secret Heir):** A "Chosen One" twist where the FMC’s blood is the only key to activating ancient, bio-mechanical "God-Machines"—merging high fantasy with a sci-fi edge.
4.  **Forced Proximity (Only One Shield):** A magical/technological "Aether-Storm" traps them in a single-room bunker behind enemy lines.
5.  **Who Did This To You?:** A classic emotional beat where the MMC discovers the FMC’s past trauma and exacts brutal vengeance.

### 3. Seriality Beats (Subscription Retention)
*   **The 15% Hook (The Star-Forge Trial):** The FMC and MMC are forced into a public combat trial where they must link their "Aether-cores" to survive.
*   **The 50% Shift (The Neon Gala Betrayal):** A secondary love interest or trusted mentor reveals themselves as the true antagonist, forcing the leads into a desperate alliance.
*   **The 90% Cliffhanger (The Awakening):** The FMC successfully activates a God-Machine, but it requires a "Soul-Bind" with the MMC that might erase his memories of her.

### 4. Viral 15-Second Pitch (TikTok/Reels/Shorts Script)
**Visual:** *Quick cuts of aesthetic images—a blood-stained dagger, a glowing blue eye, two people back-to-back in a storm.*

**Script:**
"She was sent to assassinate the Shadow Commander. 
He’s the only one who knows her blood can pilot the ancient God-Machines. 
Now they’re trapped behind enemy lines with one blade, one bed, and a bond that could burn the world down. 
If you live for 'Touch Her and You Die' and 'Lethal Enemies-to-Lovers'... 
This is your next 5-star read. 
This is *AETHERFALL*."
