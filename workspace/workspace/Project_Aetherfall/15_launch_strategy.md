## 1. The "Viral Hooks" (Social Media Snippets)
These moments are engineered for high engagement on BookTok and Instagram Reels.

*   **Hook A (The Defiance):** *"I'm not a battery. I'm the blackout. Try to draw from me again, and I’ll burn your city to the ground."* (Chapter 5).
*   **Hook B (The Shadow-Daddy):** *"You touched the only thing keeping me from burning this tier to ash. You don't get a quick death."* (Chapter 13).
*   **Hook C (The Finale):** *"I didn't just break the system. I became it. And now, I’m coming for the stars."* (Chapter 32).

## 2. Aesthetic "Vibe-Coding" (Visual Assets)
*   **Color Palette:** Obsidian Void (#0D0D0D), Radiant Gold (#D4AF37), and Aether Violet (#6A0DAD).
*   **Visual Motifs:** Shattered porcelain faces, golden liquid leaking from ears, brutalist chrome towers, and "One Bed" in a frozen wasteland.
*   **Audio Strategy:** Low-synth "Cyber" pulses transitioning into high-operatic "Gothic" choirs for the climax reveal.
