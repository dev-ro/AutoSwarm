## **1. THE BOOK BLURB (Kindle-Optimized)**

**Hook:** *She was sent to assassinate the system. He was built to protect it. Now, they are the only ones who can reboot the world.*

**The Story:**
Caelia Thorne is a glitch in the Empire’s perfect machine. Once a "Catalyst" destined for glory, she is now just a burned-out prodigy digging for crystals in the obsidian mines of Sector 4. She thought she was obsolete—until a single touch awakens an ancient God-Machine, and the Empress comes to reclaim her spark.

Kaelen Vance is the Shadow Commander, a man encased in black chrome and burdened by a debt he can never pay. He is the Empire’s most lethal weapon, and Caelia is his new mission. He’s supposed to be her captor, her mentor, and her pilot. But the "Life-Link" between them is bleeding more than just data.

Trapped between the predatory luxury of the Capital and the neon-grit of the slums, Caelia and Kaelen must navigate a world where memories are harvested and souls are processed into fuel. As Caelia’s power redlines toward a total system crash, she must decide: will she remain a resource, or will she become the blackout that burns the Empire to the ground?

**Why you’ll love it:**
