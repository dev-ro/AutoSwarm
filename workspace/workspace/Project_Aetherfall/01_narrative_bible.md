# Project: AETHERFALL - Narrative Bible

## 1. Core Premise
In a world of obsidian cities and neon-lit magic, ancient bio-mechanical "God-Machines" (The Aethel-Titans) lie dormant. Only those with the "Star-Forged" bloodline can pilot them. When Caelia, an elite assassin from the dying Resistance, is sent to kill the Shadow Commander of the Brutalist Courts, she discovers a terrifying truth: her blood is the only key to awakening the Titans, and the Commander is the only one who can keep her alive long enough to use them.

## 2. Setting: Aethelgard
*   **The Obsidian Spire:** The capital of the Brutalist Courts. A city of sharp angles, black stone, and neon cyan lights.
*   **The Grey Wastes:** The ruins of the old world, plagued by "Aether-Storms"—localized reality warps that tear flesh from bone.
*   **The Star-Forge:** A mythical orbital station (now grounded) where the Titans were originally constructed.

## 3. Magic System: Aether-Cores & Blood-Linking
*   **Aether-Cores:** Every noble in the Brutalist Courts has a synthetic core implanted in their chest to channel magical energy.
*   **Star-Forged Blood:** A natural, biological ability to interact with "Ancient Tech" without synthetic interfaces. It is extremely rare and considered a threat to the Court’s monopoly on power.
*   **The Soul-Bind:** A dangerous ritual where two individuals link their Aether-cores. It grants immense power but shares all physical sensations and emotions (the ultimate "forced intimacy" mechanic).

## 4. Key Factions
*   **The Brutalist Courts:** A high-tech, high-magic meritocracy that rules with an iron fist. They value strength, efficiency, and the "Purity of the Core."
*   **The Cinder Resistance:** Survivalists living in the Grey Wastes. They believe the Titans should be destroyed, not controlled.
*   **The Silent Archivists:** A neutral faction of scholars who hoard knowledge of the old world.

## 5. Tone and Aesthetic
*   **Tone:** Gritty, Romantic, High-Stakes, Melancholic but Hopeful.
*   **Aesthetic (Cyber-Gothic):** 
    *   *Visuals:* Heavy velvet capes over sleek, bioluminescent armor. 
    *   *Sensory:* The smell of ozone and old parchment; the sound of mechanical gears grinding against magical humming.

## 6. The Central Romance (Enemies-to-Lovers)
*   **Protagonists:** Caelia (The Assassin) vs. Kaelen (The Shadow Commander).
*   **Dynamic:** Mutual distrust masked by intense physical attraction. Kaelen is "Morally Grey" (has committed atrocities for the 'greater good' of his people), while Caelia is "Morally Driven" (will do anything to save her family).
*   **The Turning Point:** When they are forced to "Soul-Bind" to survive an Aether-Storm, making it impossible to kill each other without dying themselves.
