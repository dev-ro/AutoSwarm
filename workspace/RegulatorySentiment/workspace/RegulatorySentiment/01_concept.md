## Target Audience
- Institutional Investors
- Fintech Executives
- Compliance Officers
- Policy Makers

## Key Messaging Pillars
1. **The Hook:** Regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. is no longer a "risk"—it is a strategic bottleneck.
2. **The Contrast:** While the U.S. debates the *theory* of regulation (CLARITY Act), Hong Kong is building the *infrastructure* (March 2026 licensing).
3. **The Pivot:** Operational advice on "Regulatory Arbitrage"—moving from a wait-and-see approach to a multi-jurisdictional strategy.
4. **Sentiment Focus:** U.S. "Uncertainty" vs. Hong Kong "Execution."
